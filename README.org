* Trial Chain
** Introduction
   This project is a proof-of-concept electronic health record management system.
** Getting Started
*** Gateway
    The gateway application is built using clojure and clojurescript with the following libraries, plugins and helpful tools:

** API
*** Record
    Current data model:
    global owner, recordHash
    list trials
    list messages

    Proposed data model:
    recordHash -> (owner, trials, messages)

    Could rotate owner / recordHash
**** Functions
 #+begin_src proto3
message EmptyParams {
}

message List {
  repeated Item items = 1; 
}

message Item {
  string data = 1; 
}
 #+end_src

     AuthorizeTrial(Item)
     RevokeAuthorization(Item)
     SendMessage(Item)
     DeleteMessage(Item)
     Item GetRecord(EmptyParams)
     List GetMessages(EmptyParams)
     List GetAuthorizedTrials(EmptyParams)
     
*** TrialRegistry
    Trial registry tracks the currently running trials, with the following information:
    - Description of trial
    - Hash id of the trial

      Seems redundant, we should probably just record a single list of active trials.
      Could be merged with Record into a single master chaincode.
